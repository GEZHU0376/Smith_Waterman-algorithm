# Smith_Waterman-algorithm
Apply Smith_Waterman algorithm to a DNA sequence in order to generate a local alignment

Description:

Smith waterman algorithm utilize dynamic programming method to determine the similar region between two strings of nucleic acid
and protein sequences. Smith waterman algorithm compares segments of all the possible sequence length prior to optimize the 
final alignment.
